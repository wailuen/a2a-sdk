# Changelog

All notable changes to `agent-sdk`. SemVer applies to the stable core
(DESIGN.md §4.0); provisional surfaces (`agent_sdk.testing`, console
internals, `contrib/`) may change in minors with notice here.

## [0.1.0] — unreleased

Initial release.

### Added
- `Agent` / `build_app()`: single FastAPI app exposing A2A v0.3.0
  (HTTP+JSON), AG-UI (SSE), A2UI v0.9.1 Standard Profile v1 artifacts,
  MCP (2025-06-18, Streamable HTTP) behind OAuth 2.1, the agent card, and
  the admin console.
- `ToolSet` / `@tool` with tiers (1 = query: A2A+MCP, 2 = composite: A2A
  only), `emits=` content types, console `sample=`, adapter injection via
  keyword-only annotations, `ToolInterrupt` for input-/auth-required
  pauses with typed resume handlers.
- `SourceAdapter` base: allowed-hosts enforcement on every hop, redirect
  pinning, retry-once policy, namespaced credential resolution from the
  AES-256-GCM encrypted store.
- Loop policies: max turns, tiered tool timeouts, wall-clock deadline
  (suspended during interrupts), cumulative token budget across resumes,
  task-local result cache.
- Auth: API keys (single-use bootstrap token on zero-key startup), OAuth
  2.1 AS for `/mcp` (S256 PKCE, refresh rotation with family revocation,
  two-value audience), kind-tagged identities with per-surface assertions,
  rate limiting with trusted-proxy-aware client IPs.
- Standard Profile v1: 14 frozen content types; domain-card extension API
  (`ContentModel` subclass + own `catalog_id` + `register_content_type`).
- `agent_sdk.testing`: `FakeModelClient`, `reply`, `tool_call`.
- Admin console (vanilla JS, strict CSP) at `/admin`: keys, credentials,
  tool try-out, self-check.
- Repo-level `template/` (the ~10-file agent footprint) and `docs/`.

### Not yet shipped
- `contrib/` modules (action_gate, obo, commitments, webhooks) — planned,
  EXPERIMENTAL when they land.
- Non-Bedrock model backends ship as `ModelClient` implementations in
  agent repos (the alphageo port adds an OpenAI client behind the same
  seam).
